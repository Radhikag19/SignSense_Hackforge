**Project Overview**

The Sign Language Converter is an AI-powered real-time translation system designed to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. It supports Indian Sign Language (ISL) and provides Sign-to-Text and Text-to-Sign translation along with a chatbot for seamless communication.

**Features**
1. **Sign to Text:** Uses deep learning to convert hand gestures into text in real time.
2. **Text to Sign:** Converts input text into animated sign language gestures using a 3D avatar.
3. **Chatbot Integration:** AI-powered chatbot assists in communication.
4. **Speech-to-Text & Speech Output:** Converts speech into text and vice versa for enhanced accessibility.

**Problem Statement** - Millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals struggle due to the lack of accessible Indian Sign Language (ISL) translation tools. Existing solutions fail to support ISL, leading to communication barriers in education, workplaces, and daily life.

**Proposed Solution**

1. Our project introduces a real-time sign language translation system, integrating:
2. AI-powered gesture recognition for Sign-to-Text conversion.
3. Text-to-Sign translation using a 3D animated avatar.
4. Chatbot assistance powered by AI.
5. Speech-to-Text & Speech Output for interactive communication.

**Methodology**

1.** Sign to Text** - Captures and preprocesses hand gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
Trained on 32,000+ images to improve accuracy.
Uses TensorFlow and Keras for classification.

2. **Text to Sign**
Converts input text into Indian Sign Language gestures.
Uses Three.js and Blender for real-time 3D avatar animations.
Implemented with Angular and TypeScript.

3. **Chatbot Development**
Built using Gemini API for NLP-based chatbot interaction.
Provides interactive communication assistance.

4. **Speech-to-Text & Speech Output**
Uses Speech Recognition APIs to convert speech into text.
Converts chatbot responses into speech for accessibility.
